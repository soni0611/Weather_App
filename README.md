First thing you need to do to use this project is to clone it using the following command -
```
https://github.com/soni0611/Weather_App.git
```
Initially you would need to replace the firebase config in the index.html with your own firebase config settings so that it works on your firebase database, for more details on how to do that you can follow the process described [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

The project is divided into three sections namely Login, adding image and Gallery.
